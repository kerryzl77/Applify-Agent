As a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley with a Master's degree in Industrial Engineering & Operational Research, I bring a strong academic foundation, coupled with practical experience in data analysis and machine learning.\n\nDuring my tenure as a Data Science Intern at VIP.com, I led the integration of the DeepSeek RAG zero-shot classifier, which achieved human-level accuracy (98%) in predicting return responsibilities. This project not only required extensive use of Python, TensorFlow, and AWS - skills that you specifically mentioned, but also a deep understanding of data security principles to ensure the protection of sensitive information.\n\nIn addition to my experience at VIP.com, as a Graduate Teaching Assistant at Berkeley, I have honed my abilities in data visualization using Power BI and developed a command over SQL. I engineered a distributed LightGBM forecasting model on AWS SageMaker, improving forecasting accuracy to a 5.2% MAPE. This endeavour required constant collaboration with engineers and even automation of data processes, tasks that are integral to the role at ReliaQuest.\n\nWhat attracts me to ReliaQuest is not just the opportunity to apply my skills in a new context, but also your company's commitment to enhancing cybersecurity operations. I am excited about the idea of developing data models that can help your team thwart potential cyber threats more effectively.\n\nI am confident that my background in data science, coupled with my passion for cybersecurity, makes me a strong candidate for this role. I would love the opportunity to further discuss how my skills and experiences can benefit the team at ReliaQuest. Please feel free to contact me at zikailiu@berkeley.edu or 650-613-8398 at your earliest convenience.\n\nThank you for considering my application.\n\nSincerely,\nZikai (Kerry) Liu",

As a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with a Master's degree in Industrial Engineering & Operational Research from UC Berkeley, I am confident in my ability to leverage my skills and experiences to contribute to the safety and integrity of content across Google's services.\n\nAt VIP.com, I led the integration of DeepSeek RAG zero-shot classifier, achieving a human-level accuracy of 98% in predicting return responsibilities. This was accomplished through the use of multimodal embeddings and FAISS, demonstrating my capability to develop data-driven strategies effectively. Furthermore, I engineered a distributed LightGBM forecasting model on AWS SageMaker, which significantly improved forecasting accuracy by 5.2% MAPE and enhanced database integration for informed decisions. This experience allowed me to further refine my skills in Python, PyTorch, Java, and SQL, among others, which are all necessary tools for the role at Google.\n\nIn my current role as a Graduate Teaching Assistant at UC Berkeley, I have the opportunity to articulate complex findings to students clearly, thereby honing my communication skills, one of the key requirements for this role. Additionally, my e-commerce analytics and operational optimization experience will enable me to bring a unique perspective to the Content Safety Platform team.\n\nGoogle's commitment to creating a safe digital environment aligns with my professional interests and values. I am particularly impressed by how Google uses advanced technology to monitor and manage content. I am eager to contribute to this crucial mission and confident that my background and skills make me a strong fit for this role.\n\nI am looking forward to the possibility of discussing how I can contribute to the Content Safety Platform team at Google.
