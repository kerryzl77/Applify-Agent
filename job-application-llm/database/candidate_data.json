As a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley with a Master's degree in Industrial Engineering & Operational Research, I bring a strong academic foundation, coupled with practical experience in data analysis and machine learning.\n\nDuring my tenure as a Data Science Intern at VIP.com, I led the integration of the DeepSeek RAG zero-shot classifier, which achieved human-level accuracy (98%) in predicting return responsibilities. This project not only required extensive use of Python, TensorFlow, and AWS - skills that you specifically mentioned, but also a deep understanding of data security principles to ensure the protection of sensitive information.\n\nIn addition to my experience at VIP.com, as a Graduate Teaching Assistant at Berkeley, I have honed my abilities in data visualization using Power BI and developed a command over SQL. I engineered a distributed LightGBM forecasting model on AWS SageMaker, improving forecasting accuracy to a 5.2% MAPE. This endeavour required constant collaboration with engineers and even automation of data processes, tasks that are integral to the role at ReliaQuest.\n\nWhat attracts me to ReliaQuest is not just the opportunity to apply my skills in a new context, but also your company's commitment to enhancing cybersecurity operations. I am excited about the idea of developing data models that can help your team thwart potential cyber threats more effectively.\n\nI am confident that my background in data science, coupled with my passion for cybersecurity, makes me a strong candidate for this role. I would love the opportunity to further discuss how my skills and experiences can benefit the team at ReliaQuest.

As a Master of Engineering in Industrial Engineering & Operational Research from the University of California, Berkeley, I have honed a blend of technical and analytical skills that align closely with the job requirements.\n\nIn my current role as a Graduate Teaching Assistant at Berkeley, I have had the opportunity to dive deep into complex analytical problems using quantitative approaches. This experience has been instrumental in developing my expertise in Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and SQL, among others. I am confident in my ability to leverage these skills to generate actionable insights from data and drive product strategy at Meta.\n\nPreviously, as a Data Science Intern at VIP.com, I led the integration of DeepSeek RAG zero-shot classifier, achieving human-level accuracy (98%) in predicting return responsibilities. This project required a detailed understanding of user behaviors, long-term product trends, and data-driven project execution. Furthermore, I engineered a distributed LightGBM forecasting model on AWS SageMaker, which improved forecasting accuracy by 5.2% and facilitated informed demand planning decisions.\n\nI am excited about the prospect of working at Meta, given its commitment to harnessing the power of data to shape the future of its wide range of products. I am particularly drawn to the collaborative environment that spans multiple functions, as mentioned in your job description. I am confident that my strong technical skills, coupled with my passion for data-driven decision making, would make me a strong fit for this position.\n\nIn closing, I would appreciate the opportunity to further discuss how my background and skills would be a strong match for the Data Scientist position at Meta. I am eager to contribute my insights and leadership to your team, and I look forward to the possibility of discussing my application with you further. \n\nThank you for considering my application.\n\nBest regards,\nZikai (Kerry) Liu",
