I defined key metrics such as Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and prediction intervals to assess model performance. Challenges included addressing the spatio-temporal nature of the data, understanding complex business rules, and managing the impact of individual FC shutdowns on the overall network. By incorporating features like past seven-week day-of-week data, one-hot encoding of shutdown events, and temporal indicators (e.g., holidays, weekends), we improved prediction accuracy by over 400 basis points. This enhancement enabled more reliable forecasting and informed decision-making for planning managers."
